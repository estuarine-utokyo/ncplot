Installation

   $ mamba install -c conda-forge ncplot

To install the stable version from pypi::

   $ pip install ncplot 

Note that the version from pypi will not include the optional dependency cartopy. Some plots will look better if this is installed. Follow the instructions here if you want to install cartopy using pypi `here <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html>`__.


To install the development version from GitHub::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/pmlmodelling/ncplot.git
