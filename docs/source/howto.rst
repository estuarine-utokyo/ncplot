CMIP6 data files.

.. code:: ipython3

    ncplot(example.nc, "variable")

If you want to plot a list of variables, do the following:

.. code:: ipython3

    ncplot(example.nc, ["variable1", "variable2"])

----------------------------------------

ncplot operates as a command line tool, letting you view the contents of
a NetCDF file on a website. This feature only works in development
version right now. All you need to do is provide the file you want to
look at:

.. code:: ipython3

    ncplot example.nc
